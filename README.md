**Your files, encrypted and secure in the cloud**

SecureCloudFS encrypts your files with AES-256 *before* they leave your computer. Even we can't see your data.

> **⚠️ Important**: To upload files, you must download and run the desktop client. The web app is only for viewing and downloading existing files.

## How to Use SecureCloudFS

### Web App (View & Download Only)
**The web app CANNOT upload files. Use the desktop client below for uploads.**

Access your files from any browser:

** [Open SecureCloudFS Web App](https://secure-cloud-fs.vercel.app)**

- ✅ View all your encrypted files
- ✅ Download files to your device
- ✅ Works on any device with internet
- ❌ Cannot upload files (use desktop client for uploads)

### 💻 Desktop Client (Required for Uploading & Syncing)
**You need this to upload files or sync folders.**

Download one file and run:

```bash
# 1. Download the client (one file only)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jozefhdez/SecureCloudFS/main/securecloud.py

# 2. Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install requests cryptography watchdog python-dotenv oci supabase

# 3. Create an account
https://secure-cloud-fs.vercel.app/

# 4. Upload and sync a folder
python3 securecloud.py sync --email your@email.com --password yourpass --folder /path/to/folder
```

**Why both?** Files are encrypted on your computer before upload, so we need local software for security.
## Why SecureCloudFS?

- **True Privacy**: Files are encrypted *before* upload with your password
- **Access Anywhere**: Web interface works on any device
- **Auto Sync**: Desktop client syncs folders automatically (optional)
- **Free to Use**: No credit card required

## How Secure Is It?

- **Your password = your key** (we never see it)
- **Encrypted before upload** (not even our servers can read your files)
- **User isolation** (each user's data is completely separate)

## Perfect For

- **Personal backup** of important documents
