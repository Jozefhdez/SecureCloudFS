**🔒 Your files, encrypted and secure in the cloud**

SecureCloudFS encrypts your files with AES-256 *before* they leave your computer. Even we can't see your data.

> **⚠️ Important**: To upload files, you must download and run the desktop client. The web app is only for viewing and downloading existing files.

## 🚀 How to Use SecureCloudFS

### 🌐 Web App (View & Download Only)
**⚠️ The web app CANNOT upload files. Use the desktop client below for uploads.**

Access your files from any browser:

**👉 [Open SecureCloudFS Web App](https://secure-cloud-iof1dxs3d-jozefhdezs-projects.vercel.app/)**

- ✅ View all your encrypted files
- ✅ Download files to your device
- ✅ Works on any device with internet
- ❌ Cannot upload files (use desktop client for uploads)

### 💻 Desktop Client (Required for Uploading & Syncing)
**You need this to upload files or sync folders.**

Download one file and run:

```bash
# 1. Download the client (one file only)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jozefhdez/SecureCloudFS/main/securecloud.py

# 2. Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install requests cryptography watchdog python-dotenv oci supabase

# 3. Create an account

# 4. Upload and sync a folder

```
